## Nationwide trends
The big picture:

--

- Tenure lines have been decreasing nation-wide over several decades across all institution types

--

- ~75% of instructional positions nationwide are now held by contract faculty

--


- Part-time positions of one year or less make up the largest share of non-tenure track positions

--


- Tenure has been seen as critical to the continuation of academic freedom at universities... till now

## NYU Trends
The medium-sized picture:

--

- [NYU Adjuncts unionized](https://www.actuaw.org/) ~15 years ago and have seen [some real benefits](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NYU-Adjuncts-Local-7902-Before-and-After.pdf).

--


- A few years ago, the NYU Senate, which governs academics, was modified to include representation of contract faculty with the [Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/university-senate/membership/councils/ft-continuing-contract-faculty-senators-council.html) (C-FSC).  They have been working to standardize and improve working conditions.

--


- [NYU graduate students unionized](https://makingabetternyu.org/) and entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the university in 2014.

--


- The [effort to unionize NYU Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/) now has support from > 50% of full-time contract faculty.

## Courant happenings
The small-sized picture:

--

1. The university bylaws require all schools to have policies in place for Full-Time Continung Contract Faculty (*C-Faculty*) regarding appointments, promotions, grievances, and so on.  Courant has none.

--

1. Russ Caflish, Director of Courant, drafted a policy for C-Faculty with no consultation with C-Faculty.

--

1. Feedback was solicited on the draft, but to our knowledge, none was incorporated into the final policy.

--

1. A full faculty vote on the policy was held, including C-Faculty and Tenure/Tenure Track Faculty.  
--
**The majority voted to pass the policy**.

--

1. The C-FSC intervened and called foul, informing the Provost of the many flaws in the process and in the policy itself.

--

1. Russ thus formed this committee to revise the policy... 
--
**We threw it out.**

# Minimally important

--

## Things every policy would have
Much of our draft policy is focused on things that any policy would have.

--

- Clarity on *job titles*, *job expectations*, and *terms* of appointment.

--

- Clarity on the *reappointment* process.

--

- Clarity on the *promotions* process.

--

- Clarity on the *grievances* process

--

- Restatement of existing NYU policies: 
--
*right to switch to Tenure-Track positions*, 
--
*right to hold meetings*, 
--
*right to be principal investigator on research*, 
--
*eligibility for university housing* (no matter how unlikely), 
--
*right to course buyouts*, 
--
*right to outside employment 1 day per week*, 
--
*right to paid and unpaid leave* for a variety of reasons.

--

*These are basics of any policy and are nothing to be especially proud of.*

# Nice to haves

--

## A step up from the bottom
On top of the bare minimum, a few reasonable rights.

--

- Good-faith attempts at *course load equity* among C-Faculty.

--

- The possibility of *course load reductions* for a variety of mundane reasons including curriculum development and course mode conversions.

--

- Guaranteed *contract clock stoppage* for major life events and global pandemics, equivalent to the tenure clock stoppage policy.

--

- Notification dates of reappointment/promotion decisions that give *ample time for negotiation* and appeals of negative decisions.

--

- The *right to academic freedom*, like Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty have.

--

- *Self-governance*: C-Faculty should be the majority on their reappointment, promotion, and grievance committees.  
--
Only C-Faculty vote on the C-Faculty policy.  
--
C-Faculty should be involved in hiring C-Faculty.

--

*These are little things that show that we have a little bit of dignity.*

# Worth fighting for

--

## The big stuff
Now we come to policies of material value.

--

- *Equal rights*: C-Faculty should have the same basic rights as Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty, except on issues related to tenure.  
--
This includes equal voting rights and the right to serve in all leadership positions.

--

- A promise of *professsional development funds*, including 2-year rollover of unused funds.  
--
The requirement of a financial justification if they are ever withheld.

--

- *Guarantee of reappointment*, barring any structural/curricular changes or job performance issues.  
--
1 year of termination pay if not reappointed for any other reason.

--

- *Sabbatical* - eligibility after 6 years of service, just like Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty.

--

*If we want these things, we must be ready to vote for them.*
