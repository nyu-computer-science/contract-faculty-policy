# Background

## Requirement of a C-Faculty policy

The Faculty Handbook’s [Formation of School Policies](https://www.nyu.edu/faculty/governance-policies-and-procedures/faculty-handbook/the-faculty/faculty-policies-applicable-to-full-time-continuing-contract-faculty/formulation-of-school-policies.html) states:

> Each school governed by the University Guidelines is required to establish its own policies governing the appointment, review, and reappointment of Continuing Contract Faculty consistent with school culture and history, and sensitive to the diversity of Continuing Contract Faculty roles and responsibilities in the school. These policies must contain a comprehensive set of procedures that conform to the general principles set forth herein, and must appear in a document that is readily available (in print and on the web) to all faculty members of the school.

--

_At the time of this writing, Courant has no documented policy in place to govern Continuing Contract Faculty’s role in Institute or department governance nor the rules and procedures for their appointment, reappointment, or promotion._

## Requirement to include C-Faculty on all governance committees

The Faculty Handbook’s Titles & Terms of Employment section on [Participation in School Governance](https://www.nyu.edu/faculty/governance-policies-and-procedures/faculty-handbook/the-faculty/faculty-policies-applicable-to-full-time-continuing-contract-faculty/titles-and-terms-of-employment.html) states:

> Schools are expected to permit Continuing Contract Faculty to be represented within their respective school governance bodies, and to include Continuing Contract Faculty on appropriate committees, except for those involving tenure decisions or those otherwise set aside by University Bylaws as falling within the exclusive domain of tenured and tenure track faculty.

--

_Courant C-Faculty currently seem to be excluded from some committees, perhaps most notably the Courant Steering Committee._

---

## Requirement of a grievance policy

The Faculty Handbook’s Grievance Procedures state:

> Each school shall have a formal and written grievance policy that is widely available and easily accessible to faculty, reflective of the distinctive culture of the school

--

_Courant has so far not put in place any such grievance policy._

## The 2015 C-Faculty Policy

In Janury 2015, [a policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072656/http://cims.nyu.edu/admin/Contract_Faculty_Policy_Revised_Jan_2015.pdf) governing Continuing Contract Faculty appointments and promotions was put into place **without any involvement of C-Faculty**.

--

- A [minor revision](https://cims.nyu.edu/media/cims/filer_public/5a/06/5a06d26f-e158-4e4c-83a4-855b59548280/cfacultypolicy2019.pdf) to the 2015 policy was completed in February 2019, again **without C-Faculty involvement**, although we can find no evidence that this was ever published or shared with the faculty.

--

- The link to the 2015 C-Faculty policy was [intentionally removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20190712094200/https://cims.nyu.edu/resources/for_faculty.html) from Courant’s website and replaced with a link to University-wide policies by July 2019.

--

- Given that the Faculty Handbook explicitly requires a policy to be “_readily available (in print and on the web) to all faculty members of the school_”, we assume this policy was retracted purposefully.

## The 2019 C-Faculty Policy Proposal

In November 2019, [a new policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wc6ZkUUIILEIrmwg-zD3tn3L737bdLy3/view?usp=sharing), again written **without C-Faculty involvement**, was put up for vote.

--

- **It passed**. Of the 36 C-Faculty at the time, 13 voted “yes” and 6 “no”. Of the 103 T-Faculty, 45 voted “yes” and 1 “no”.

--

- The policy was sent to the Provost for approval.

--

- However, both the Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council (**C-FSC**) and the Tenured/Tenure Track Faculty Senators Council (**T-FSC**) **wrote letters to the Provost raising concerns about the policy** terms and the process by which it had been written (see letters [here](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/facultyGovernance/documents/C-FSC%20Letter%20and%20Recommendations%20Courant%20C-faculty%20Policy.pdf) and [here](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/facultyGovernance/documents/T-FSC%20Memo%20on%20Courant-5-8-20.pdf)).

--

- The policy was never approved by the Provost.

## The February 2021 C-Faculty Policy Draft

In October 2020, following the feedback from the C-FSC and T-FSC, **a Courant C-Faculty Policy Committee was formed** to write a new draft policy.

--

- **This committee included C-Faculty**: 2 elected C-Faculty, 2 appointed C-Faculty, and 2 appointed T-Faculty.

--

- The committee delivered a [completely rewritten policy draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AzjVaiySUMW8mhPhMmXvcCtoYI07679mUDXU6ZNSoa0/edit) to Courant Director, Russ Caflisch, for review on February 7, 2021.

--

- We heard nothing for 6 months...

## The August 2021 C-Faculty Policy Proposal

On August 25, 2021, Courant Director responded to the Courant C-Faculty Policy Committee with [a new completely rewritten policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V2TMtI967PRcR2hMhxU3fafIqHHs8GAK/view?usp=sharing)

--

- This policy was drafted by the Director and the Courant Steering Committee (primarily Bruce Kleiner and Michael Overton), **without consultation of the C-Faculty Policy Committee**.

--

- The C-Faculty Policy Committee and the Director agreed to put the new policy up for vote.

--

- **It failed to pass.** Of the 36 C-Faculty at the time, _1 voted “yes” and 32 “no”_. Of the 103 T-Faculty, 36 voted “yes” and 7 “no”.

# What Happens Now

--

## The Director's way forward

On 19 November 2021, The Courant C-Faculty Policy Committee met with Director Caflisch to discuss what will happen next. **The Director said**:

--

- Nobody had ever asked what might happen if C-Faculty voted "no" on the policy put up for vote.

--

- Since the vote was "no", Courant will reinstate the [2015 policy](#2015-policy).

--

name: director-claims

- This policy was the de fact current policy anyway and had been published on the website for anyone to see.

# Committee's Response

--

## Fact-check

The committee checked the facts of [the Director's claims](#director-claims). **We found**:

--

- ❌ Nobody had ever asked what might happen if C-Faculty voted "no" on the policy put up for vote.

_In fact, the committee co-chairs had asked this exact question during a meeting with the Director. And in a meeting of the tenured/tenure-track faculty, someone had asked as well, but neither the Director nor the Steering Committee had volunteered an answer._

--

- ❌ Since the vote was "no", Courant will reinstate the [2015 policy](#2015-policy).

- ❌ This policy was the de fact current policy anyway and had been published on the website for anyone to see.

_ [Web archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20150905170241/http:/www.cims.nyu.edu/admin/Contract_Faculty_Policy_Revised_Jan_2015.pdf) show that the 2015 policy had been explicitly taken down by early 2019 at the latest. Its 2019 revision seems to have [never been published at all](https://web.archive.org/web/20190712094200/https://cims.nyu.edu/resources/for_faculty.html#cellphones). Thus C-Faculty had no possible way to know of the existence of either version._

## Letter to the Director

On 23 November 2021, the C-Faculty Police Committee sent a response [letter to the Director](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bVaDrUtGtO6S3i8B7NkDbASyqpxKW1t-/view?usp=sharing), including:

--

- Our belief that _implementing the [2015 policy](#2015-policy) (or its 2019 revision) would be unjust, unfair, and would probably raise concerns from the C-FSC and T-FSC and fail to be approved by the Provost_.

--

- An explanation for _why the C-Faculty overwhelmingly voted "no" on the [August 2021 Policy Proposal](#2021-directors-policy)_.

--

- A final appeal for _specific policy terms for which C-Faculty would readily vote "yes"_.

# Specific Requests

In its letter to the Director, the committee made 7 specific policy requests.

---

template: requests

## 1 of 7

> Majority elected C-Faculty on C-Faculty reappointment & promotions committees.
>
> _We have heard many complaints about bias and unfairness in reappointments and promotions,
> especially within Math. Many C-Faculty feel that raising their individual voices is too risky, given their contingent positions, and so they are looking to this policy or a Governance Policy to solve what is perceived to be a chronic issue that has been brought to leadership’s attention by our Committee but ignored. It doesn’t matter to C-Faculty whether this issue is addressed in this policy or in a Governance Policy, as long as they can feel confident that elected C-Faculty have a prominent voice in these committees._

---

template: requests

## 2 of 7

> The C-Faculty will be able to vote on all policies and changes of policy that affect them via secret ballot.
>
> _C-Faculty have a justifiable fear that policies that govern their roles and their work may be put into place without their involvement and consent. There must be a commitment that any such policy requires a “yes” from a majority of C-Faculty. Secret ballots are extremely important to the C-Faculty, who often feel that expressing opinions contrary to the administration can put their reappointment and promotion at risk. We believe these fears are justified and that this problem of possible retribution should be acknowledged and addressed._

---

template: requests

## 3 of 7

> Paid leave for professional development, eligible after 6 years service.
>
> _Several other schools and even some FAS departments have this (albeit at department level). Other universities have this in their equivalent departments and some have even approached our faculty (see [this example job post from Columbia](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/resources/faculty-job-openings/), where it is called “Dean’s Leave”; SPS calls it “[Special Academic Leave](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/content/sps/homepage/academics/office-of-academic-and-faculty-affairs/policies-and-documents/special-academic-leave.html)”, Gallatin and Tisch call it sabbatical, Liberal Studies doesn’t give it a name but has it). It is not important to C-Faculty what this is called nor how this is achieved, as long as it is granted. We reject the suggestion that C-Faculty at Courant are somehow different or less qualified than the majority of ordinary C-Faculty at these other schools and institutions who benefit from such a policy. If the Provost resists a leave policy, C-Faculty place their hopes in leadership’s willingness to advocate for it on their behalf and we are happy to work together to formulate a winning argument in favor of this._

---

template: requests

## 4 of 7

> Candidates may request promotion review in coordination with any reappointment review and any year after their second reappointment in rank, but not more often than once every two years.
>
> _FAS policy includes this._

---

template: requests

## 5 of 7

> Initial appointment terms are at the discretion of the department. Subsequent appointments should be 3 years for Clinical Assistant Faculty, 5 years for Clinical Associate Faculty, and 6 years for Clinical Faculty.
>
> _Courant C-Faculty don’t understand why our policy would permit appointment terms at the bottom end of what we see in other NYU schools and departments. Given the huge demand for people with their skills in industry, within academia, and within Courant itself, the C-Faculty do not consider it acceptable that the administration would place them at the bottom tier of NYU contract faculty in this regard._

---

template: requests

## 6 of 7

> Continuing Contract Faculty in prior good performance will receive good-faith consideration for reappointment, barring curricular/structural changes or performance issues.
>
> _The adjunct union successfully negotiated this years ago and C-Faculty rightfully expect the same guarantee. C-Faculty might reasonably be expected to put their energies into supporting the union rather than vote “yes” for a policy that is inferior in most ways to what the union would likely deliver. Ideally, Courant would offer something better and be a beacon of good relations with C-Faculty within the university, rather than a case study in why C-Faculty at NYU need to unionize._

---

template: requests

## 7 of 7

> Written promise of C-Faculty equal voting rights to T-Faculty, except on issues related to Tenure, as a core feature of any future Governance Policy.
>
> _The 2015 policy included this sentiment. T-Faculty and C-Faculty perform separate roles, yet, as the pandemic has made especially clear, both are critical to the budgets and operations of Courant. That T-Faculty were able to vote on the C-Faculty policy, but not vice versa, exacerbated the general perception based on all the points above that Courant leadership intends to exclude C-Faculty voices from their own governance. Since many C-Faculty concerns are, in fact, governance-related, a statement of principle such as this would go a long way towards repairing the rift._

---

template: requests

## The status of our requests

- Our committee's T-Faculty members met with the Director to help contextualize some of our requests.

--

- We have updated the C-FSC of the goings-on at Courant.

--

- It would help to be vocal and organized while the Director and the Steering Committee consider our requests.
