# Overview

--

## The purpose of a C-Faculty policy

The university bylaws _require all schools to have policies_ in place for Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty (_C-Faculty_) regarding appointments, promotions, grievances, involvement in governance, and so on.

--

- _Courant is without a C-Faculty policy_. It is one of the only schools at NYU with this distinction.

--

- In practice, _each department has unwritten policies_ for how contract faculty are involved in department governance and for the terms of their appointments, reappointments, and grievances.

--

- Unwritten policies tend towards _cronyism, selective enforcement of rules, bias, obscurantism, and general lack of accountability_.

--

- A lack of a written policy also _leaves Courant open to accusations of these evils_. It's a liability to the university.

---

## Background

Courant attempted to ratify a C-Faculty policy in 2019.

--

- Russ Caflish, Director of Courant, drafted the policy for C-Faculty

--
with _no involvement from C-Faculty_.

--

- Feedback was solicited on the draft just before the vote.

--
_None of the feedback was incorporated into the final policy_.

--

- A full faculty vote on the policy was held.

--

- _The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the policy..._

--

- This primarily because _95%+ of T-Faculty voted in favor of it_ and T-Faculty are a majority at Courant

--

- _There was no guarantee of anonymity in the vote_, so C-Faculty could not be sure a "no" vote wouldn't lead to retribution.

## C-FSC's Criticisms

--

The policy was sent to the Provost for approval. The Provost shared it with the C-FSC. _Luckily, the C-FSC intervened_, noting in [a letter to the Provost](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hG_S_9k9Dg2vgbkSkt5NZ2AVTlxprbA/view?usp=sharing):

--

- _C-Faculty were not involved at all_ in drafting the policy

--

- _There is no formal governance structure_ at Courant at all

--

- _The policy did not guarantee time for C-Faculty to discuss and suggest amendments_

--

- _Appointment and reappointment terms were shorter than NYU norms_

--

- _Allowed for repeated one or two year appointments_, against NYU norms

--

- _Limited when C-Faculty could request promotion_, against norms

--

- _No commitment to reappoint C-Faculty in good standing_, even when there is a need for their position to be re-filled

---

template: overview

## Background (continued again)

- _No extra funds or leave provided for professional/scholarly/creative work_, even though such work is considered when evaluating candidates for reappointment & promotion

--

- _No independence of the C-Faculty Reappointment & Promotions Committee (C-Faculty RPC)_... it should be majority elected C-Faculty and hold secret votes on candidates for reappointment/promotion that are meaningful

--

- _No transparency given to candidates of the reasoning behind a negative reappointment, promotion, or grievance decision_

--

- _No obligation of Director to justify a decision that runs contrary to that of the C-Faculty RPC_

--

- _No grievance process developed by an elected committee including C-Faculty and voted for by all faculty_

--

- _No guarantee grievance committee will be primarily elected C-Faculty_

---

template: overview

## Policy committee

Based on the C-FSC's damning feedback, the Provost asked Russ to redo the process of drafting the policy. A committee was formed:

--

- **Shizhu Liu** (co-chair; appointed Contract Faculty - Math)

- **Anasse Bari** (co-chair; appointed Contract Faculty - CS)

- **Shafer Smith** (appointed Tenured Faculty - Math)

- **Ernie Davis** (appointed Tenured Faculty - CS)

- **Elizabeth Stepp** (elected Contract Faculty - Math)

- **Amos Bloomberg** (elected Contract Faculty - CS)

---

template: overview

## Our work

We have...

--

- Researched _national trends_.

--

- Reviewed all of _C-FSC's written feedback_ to Russ's original policy.

--

- Researched _all NYU policies_ applicable to contract faculty.

--

- _Interviewed C-Faculty_ we could get hold of for their views.

--

- _Conferred with other NYU contract faculty organizations_, including the C-FSC and the Contract Faculty Union organizers.

--

- Reviewed equivalent _policies at other NYU schools_.

--

- Drafted a new policy _from scratch_.

--

- [Communicated our findings and the goals of our draft policy](../proposal/) to other C-Faculty in both Math and CS.

## Policy ratification process

The [still unwritten] process for ratifying the policy is likely to be:

1. Committee submits draft to Director of Courant, Russ Caflisch (_2/7/21_)

--

1. Director shares policy with all faculty

--

1. Faculty vote on Director's policy

--

1. Director sends policy to Provost

# Committee's Draft Policy

--

## Addressing C-FSC's criticisms

The [committee's draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AzjVaiySUMW8mhPhMmXvcCtoYI07679mUDXU6ZNSoa0/edit?usp=sharing), _written from scratch_, addressed the C-FSC's criticisms:

--

- _Ensuring C-Faculty are involved in future amendments_ to the policy

--

- _Establishing C-Faculty's equal rights in governance_, except on issues related to tenure

--

- _Ensuring ample time for C-Faculty to discuss and recommend changes to any future policy amendments_ before a vote

--

- _Appointment and reappointment terms that are in-line with recent norms_.

--

- _Allowing repeated one or two year appointments only in exceptional circumstances_, with a requirement of written justification

--

- _Allowing C-Faculty to request promotion in any year_

--

- _A commitment to reappoint C-Faculty in good standing_, when there is a need for their position to be re-filled

---

template: draft-policy

## Addressing C-FSC's criticisms (continued)

- _Extra funds and leave provided for professional/scholarly/creative work_, since such work is considered when evaluating candidates for reappointment & promotion

--

- _Independence of the C-Faculty Reappointment & Promotions Committee (C-Faculty RPC)_, making it majority elected C-Faculty and holding secret votes on candidates for reappointment/promotion that are meaningful

--

- _Transparency given to candidates of the reasoning behind a negative reappointment, promotion, or grievance decision_

--

- _An obligation of Director to justify a decision that runs contrary to that of the C-Faculty RPC_

--

- _A grievance process developed by an elected committee including C-Faculty and voted for by all faculty_

--

- _Guarantee that the grievance committee will be primarily elected C-Faculty_

---

template: draft-policy

## Furthering C-Faculty rights

The Committee's policy went beyond simply addressing the C-FSC's concerns:

--

- _Standardization of job titles_ (Math uses Lecturer titles against norms)

--

- _Explicit expectations_ for teaching, service, administration, and research

--

- _Explicit list of materials considered during reappointment and promotion processes_

--

- Ensuring that reappointment decisions give _ample time for the candidates to consider an offer and negotatiate_

--

- Guaranteeing _"good faith effort" at distributing teaching load_ equitably among C-Faculty

--

- Explicitly stating _C-Faculty eligibility for leadership positions_

--

- Guaranteeing _all C-Faculty votes are anonymous_, to avoid fear

---

template: draft-policy

## Furthering C-Faculty rights (continued)

- Specifying the _composition and rules for all C-Faculty-related committees_ to ensure majority of elected C-Faculty and to avoid conflicts of interest.

--

- Specifying _C-Faculty's right to academic freedom_, with the same limitations as for T-Faculty.

--

- _Allowing for contract clock stoppage_, when approved for medical, personal, or family reasons.

--

- Requiring _termination pay for any C-Faculty in good standing who are not reappointed_, despite a need to re-fill their position

--

- Helpful _links to relevant university-wide policies_ applicable to C-Faculty.

# Considerations

--

## Political situation

Courant C-Faculty should be aware of some external considerations on the upcoming policy vote.

--

- _Director Russ Caflisch is anxious to get this policy finished_ after 2 years in progress. _He is also up for a job review_ in 2022.

--

- Russ has said that a separate Governance Policy will be drafted, although he has not shared with us who will work on that nor when it might be done. _Russ has denied our request to delay a vote on this policy until a Governance Policy is finished_.

--

- _The Contract Faculty Union effort is picking up steam again_ now that classes are in-person. Several of the substantive recommendations from our draft policy are based on policies the union has negotiated on behalf of adjunct faculty and grad student employees.

--

- _The C-FSC has explicitly advised us that we should not be afraid to carry on without a policy in place_.

---

template: considerations

## Setting expectations

Everything is going according to plan.

--

- _It's entirely possible that the C-FSC will again advise the Provost to reject this policy_, since it fails to address most of their concerns

--

- _It has always been our expectation that we would have to be willing to vote "no"_ in order to get any substantive concessions from leadership

--

- _Russ has promised us that in order for this policy to go forward, it requires a majority "yes" vote from both the T-Faculty and C-Faculty, counted separately_

--

- Your vote counts (at least this one time)!
