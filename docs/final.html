# Overview

--

## Background

University bylaws _require all schools to have policies_ in place for Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty (_C-Faculty_) regarding appointments, promotions, grievances, involvement in governance, and so on.

--

- Courant is one of the last schools without a policy.

--

- Russ Caflish, Director of Courant, drafted a policy for C-Faculty in 2019

--

- A full faculty vote on the policy was held, and _the majority of faculty voted in favor of the policy_

--

- The policy was sent to the Provost for approval.

--

- The Provost shared it with the Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council (C-FSC), a part of the University-wide Senate.

--

- _The C-FSC intervened_. They wrote a letter to the Provost, noting many concerns with the policy and how it was formulated.

---

template: overview

## Background (continued)

- _A committee was formed to revise the policy_ with 2 appointed T-Faculty, 2 appointed C-Faculty and 2 elected C-Faculty.

--

- _The committe drafted a revised policy_, after researching national trends and all university policies; speaking with C-Faculty and members of the C-FSC and organizers of the Contract Faculty Union effort

## C-FSC's concerns

The main concerns outlined in [the C-FSC's letter to the Provost](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hG_S_9k9Dg2vgbkSkt5NZ2AVTlxprbA/view?usp=sharing)...

--

- _C-Faculty were not involved_ in drafting the policy

--

- There is _no formal governance structure_ at Courant

--

- The policy _did not guarantee adequate time for C-Faculty to discuss_ and suggest amendments

--

- _Appointment and reappointment terms were shorter than NYU norms_

--

- _Allowed for repeated one or two year appointments_, against NYU norms

--

- _Limited when C-Faculty could request promotion_, against norms

--

- _No commitment to reappoint C-Faculty in good standing_, even when there is a need for their position to be re-filled

---

template: overview

## C-FSC's concerns (continued)

- _No extra funds or leave provided for professional/scholarly/creative work_, even though such work is considered when evaluating candidates for reappointment & promotion

--

- _No independence of the C-Faculty Reappointment & Promotions Committee (C-Faculty RPC)_... it should be majority elected C-Faculty and hold secret votes on candidates for reappointment/promotion that are meaningful

--

- _No explanation given to candidates of the reasoning behind a negative reappointment, promotion, or grievance decision_

--

- _No obligation of Director to justify a decision that runs contrary to that of the C-Faculty RPC_

--

- _No guarantee of involvement of elected C-Faculty in developing the grievance process_

# Committee's Draft Policy

--

## Addressing C-FSC's concerns

The [committee's draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AzjVaiySUMW8mhPhMmXvcCtoYI07679mUDXU6ZNSoa0/edit?usp=sharing), addressed all of the C-FSC's concerns:

--

- _Ensuring C-Faculty are involved in future amendments_ to the policy

--

- _Establishing C-Faculty's equal rights in governance_, except on issues related to tenure

--

- _Ensuring ample time for C-Faculty to discuss and recommend changes to any future policy amendments_ before a vote

--

- _Appointment and reappointment terms that are in-line with recent norms_.

--

- _Allowing repeated one or two year appointments only in exceptional circumstances_, with a requirement of written justification

--

- _Allowing C-Faculty to request promotion in any year_

--

- _A commitment to reappoint C-Faculty in good standing_, when there is a need for their position to be re-filled

---

template: draft-policy

## Addressing C-FSC's concerns (continued)

- _Extra funds guaranteed and leave possible for professional/scholarly/creative work_, since such work is considered when evaluating candidates for reappointment & promotion

--

- _Independence of the C-Faculty Reappointment & Promotions Committee (C-Faculty RPC)_, making it majority elected C-Faculty and holding secret votes on candidates for reappointment/promotion that are meaningful

--

- _Explanation given to candidates of the reasoning behind a negative reappointment, promotion, or grievance decision_

--

- _An obligation of Director to justify a decision that runs contrary to that of the C-Faculty RPC_

--

- _A grievance process developed by a committee that includes majority elected C-Faculty and is voted on by all faculty_

---

template: draft-policy

## Additional recommendations

The Committee's policy went beyond simply addressing the C-FSC's concerns:

--

- _Standardization of job titles_ (Math uses Lecturer titles against norms)

--

- _Explicit expectations_ for teaching, service, administration, and research

--

- _Explicit list of materials considered during reappointment and promotion processes_

--

- Ensuring that reappointment decisions give _ample time for the candidates to consider an offer and negotatiate_

--

- Guaranteeing _reappointments are at the same salary or higher_

--

- Guaranteeing _"good faith efforts" at distributing teaching load_ equitably among C-Faculty

--

- Explicitly stating _C-Faculty eligibility for leadership positions_

---

template: draft-policy

## Additional recommendations (continued)

- Guaranteeing _all C-Faculty votes are anonymous_, to avoid retribution

--

- Specifying the _composition and rules for all C-Faculty-related committees_ to ensure a majority of elected C-Faculty and to avoid conflicts of interest.

--

- Specifying _C-Faculty's right to academic freedom_, with the same limitations as for T-Faculty.

--

- _Allowing for contract clock stoppage_, with approval, for medical, personal, or family reasons.

--

- Requiring _termination pay for any C-Faculty in good standing who are not reappointed_, despite a need to re-fill their position

--

- _Only C-Faculty should vote on C-Faculty-specific issues_.

--

- Helpful _links to relevant university-wide policies_ applicable to C-Faculty.

# Considerations

--

## Additional information

Courant C-Faculty should be aware of some external considerations.

--

- Director Russ Caflisch has said that _professional development funds will be returned in near future_. But he has declined to write the existence of these funds into the policy, despite the C-FSC's and Committee's requests to do so and their relationship to materials considered in reappointment and promotion reviews.

--

- Russ has promised us that _approval of this policy requires a majority "yes" vote from both the T-Faculty and C-Faculty groups, counted independently_. This is also written into the policy for future votes on amendments.

--

- Russ has also promised us that _this vote will be anonymous_, but has declined to write a guarantee of secrecy/anonymity into the various types of votes specified in the policy itself.

---

template: considerations

## Additional information (continued)

- Russ has said that _a separate Governance Policy will be worked on_, once this policy is in place.

--

- Russ has _denied our request to delay a vote on this policy until a Governance Policy is in place_.

--

- _Russ is eager to get this policy finished_ after 2 years in progress. He is up for a job review in 2022.

--

- _The Contract Faculty Union effort is picking up momentum again_ now that classes are in-person. A majority of C-Faculty in the university support the union. Several of the substantive recommendations from our draft policy are based on policies the union has successfully negotiated on behalf of adjunct faculty and grad student employees.

---

template: considerations

## Additional information (continued again)

- _It's possible that the C-FSC will again advise the Provost to reject this policy_, since it fails to address most of their concerns.

--

- Members of the C-FSC have explicitly advised us that _we should not be afraid to carry on without a policy in place_.
