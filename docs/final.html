# Overview

--

## The purpose of a C-Faculty policy

The university bylaws _require all schools to have policies_ in place for Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty (_C-Faculty_) regarding appointments, promotions, grievances, involvement in governance, and so on.

--

- _Courant is without a C-Faculty policy_. It is one of the only schools at NYU with this distinction.

--

- In practice, _each department has unwritten policies_ for how C-Faculty are involved (or not) in department governance and for the terms of their appointments, reappointments, and grievances.

--

- Unwritten policies tend towards _cronyism, selective enforcement of rules, bias, obscurantism, and general lack of accountability_.

--

- A lack of a written policy also _leaves Courant open to accusations of these evils_. It's a liability to the university.

---

## Background

Courant attempted to ratify a C-Faculty policy in 2019.

--

- Russ Caflish, Director of Courant, drafted the policy for C-Faculty

--
with _no involvement from C-Faculty_.

--

- Feedback was solicited on the draft just before the vote.

--
_None of the feedback was incorporated into the final policy_.

--

- A full faculty vote on the policy was held.

--
_The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the policy..._

--

- This primarily because _95%+ of T-Faculty voted in favor of it_ and T-Faculty are a majority at Courant

--

- _There was no guarantee of anonymity in the vote_, so C-Faculty could not be sure a "no" vote wouldn't lead to retribution.

## C-FSC's Criticisms

--

The policy was sent to the Provost for approval. The Provost shared it with the Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council (C-FSC). _Luckily, the C-FSC intervened_, noting in [a letter to the Provost](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hG_S_9k9Dg2vgbkSkt5NZ2AVTlxprbA/view?usp=sharing):

--

- _C-Faculty were not involved at all_ in drafting the policy

--

- _There is no formal governance structure_ at Courant at all

--

- _The policy did not guarantee time for C-Faculty to discuss and suggest amendments_

--

- _Appointment and reappointment terms were shorter than NYU norms_

--

- _Allowed for repeated one or two year appointments_, against NYU norms

--

- _Limited when C-Faculty could request promotion_, against norms

--

- _No commitment to reappoint C-Faculty in good standing_, even when there is a need for their position to be re-filled

---

template: overview

## C-FSC's Criticisms (continued)

- _No extra funds or leave provided for professional/scholarly/creative work_, even though such work is considered when evaluating candidates for reappointment & promotion

--

- _No independence of the C-Faculty Reappointment & Promotions Committee (C-Faculty RPC)_... it should be majority elected C-Faculty and hold secret votes on candidates for reappointment/promotion that are meaningful

--

- _No transparency given to candidates of the reasoning behind a negative reappointment, promotion, or grievance decision_

--

- _No obligation of Director to justify a decision that runs contrary to that of the C-Faculty RPC_

--

- _No grievance process developed by an elected committee including C-Faculty and voted for by all faculty_

--

- _No guarantee grievance committee will be primarily elected C-Faculty_

---

template: overview

## Policy committee

Based on the C-FSC's damning feedback, the Provost asked Russ to redo the process of drafting the policy. A committee was formed:

--

- **Shizhu Liu** (co-chair; appointed Contract Faculty - Math)

- **Anasse Bari** (co-chair; appointed Contract Faculty - CS)

- **Shafer Smith** (appointed Tenured Faculty - Math)

- **Ernie Davis** (appointed Tenured Faculty - CS)

- **Elizabeth Stepp** (elected Contract Faculty - Math)

- **Amos Bloomberg** (elected Contract Faculty - CS)

---

## Our work

We have...

--

- Researched _national trends_.

--

- Reviewed all of _C-FSC's written feedback_ to Russ's original policy.

--

- Researched and compared [all NYU policies applicable to contract faculty](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w76jygcwvHMT1q_Vzi4_rNbd-OBsiYj3cUUc6p8kCSs/edit?usp=sharing).

--

- _Interviewed C-Faculty_ we could get hold of for their views.

--

- _Conferred with other NYU contract faculty organizations_, including the C-FSC and the Contract Faculty Union organizers.

--

- Reviewed equivalent _policies at other NYU schools_.

--

- Drafted a new policy _from scratch_.

--

- [Communicated our findings and the goals of our draft policy](../proposal/) to other C-Faculty in both Math and CS.

--

1. Director shares policy with all faculty

--

1. Faculty vote on Director's policy

# Committee's Draft Policy

--

## Addressing C-FSC's criticisms

The [committee's draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AzjVaiySUMW8mhPhMmXvcCtoYI07679mUDXU6ZNSoa0/edit?usp=sharing), _written from scratch_, addressed the C-FSC's criticisms:

--

- _Ensuring C-Faculty are involved in future amendments_ to the policy

--

- _Establishing C-Faculty's equal rights in governance_, except on issues related to tenure

--

- _Ensuring ample time for C-Faculty to discuss and recommend changes to any future policy amendments_ before a vote

--

- _Appointment and reappointment terms that are in-line with recent norms_.

--

- _Allowing repeated one or two year appointments only in exceptional circumstances_, with a requirement of written justification

--

- _Allowing C-Faculty to request promotion in any year_

--

- _A commitment to reappoint C-Faculty in good standing_, when there is a need for their position to be re-filled

---

template: draft-policy

## Addressing C-FSC's criticisms (continued)

- _Extra funds and leave provided for professional/scholarly/creative work_, since such work is considered when evaluating candidates for reappointment & promotion

--

- _Independence of the C-Faculty Reappointment & Promotions Committee (C-Faculty RPC)_, making it majority elected C-Faculty and holding secret votes on candidates for reappointment/promotion that are meaningful

--

- _Transparency given to candidates of the reasoning behind a negative reappointment, promotion, or grievance decision_

--

- _An obligation of Director to justify a decision that runs contrary to that of the C-Faculty RPC_

--

- _A grievance process developed by an elected committee including C-Faculty and voted for by all faculty_

--

- _Guarantee that the grievance committee will be primarily elected C-Faculty_

---

template: draft-policy

## Furthering C-Faculty rights

The Committee's policy went beyond simply addressing the C-FSC's concerns:

--

- _Standardization of job titles_ (Math uses Lecturer titles against norms)

--

- _Explicit expectations_ for teaching, service, administration, and research

--

- _Explicit list of materials considered during reappointment and promotion processes_

--

- Ensuring that reappointment decisions give _ample time for the candidates to consider an offer and negotatiate_

--

- Guaranteeing _"good faith efforts" at distributing teaching load_ equitably among C-Faculty

--

- Explicitly stating _C-Faculty eligibility for leadership positions_

--

- Guaranteeing _all C-Faculty votes are anonymous_, to avoid retribution

---

template: draft-policy

## Furthering C-Faculty rights (continued)

- Specifying the _composition and rules for all C-Faculty-related committees_ to ensure majority of elected C-Faculty and to avoid conflicts of interest.

--

- Specifying _C-Faculty's right to academic freedom_, with the same limitations as for T-Faculty.

--

- _Allowing for contract clock stoppage_, with approval, for medical, personal, or family reasons.

--

- Requiring _termination pay for any C-Faculty in good standing who are not reappointed_, despite a need to re-fill their position

--

- Helpful _links to relevant university-wide policies_ applicable to C-Faculty.

---

# Considerations

--

## Additional information

Courant C-Faculty should be aware of some external considerations.

- _Director Russ Caflisch has said that professional development funds will be returned at some point_. The amount will be less for Math than for CS. But _he has refused to write the existence of these funds into the policy_, despite their relationship to materials considered in reappointment and promotion reviews.

--

- _Russ has promised us that in order for this policy to go forward, it requires a majority "yes" vote from both the T-Faculty and C-Faculty groups, counted separately_. This is also written into the policy for future votes on amendments to this policy.

--

- _Russ has also promised us that this vote will be anonymous_, but has refused to write a guarantee of anonymity into the various types of votes specified in the policy itself.

---

template: considerations

## Additional information (continued)

- Russ has said that _a separate Governance Policy will be drafted at some point_. We don't expect most of our governance-related recommendations to survive. He has not shared with us the process for how that policy will be drafted nor when it might be done. Based on what was written in this policy, _we expect that no elected C-Faculty will be involved_.

--

- _Russ has denied our request to delay a vote on this policy until a Governance Policy is in place_. The Committee has clearly communicated that having a Governance Policy in place first make sense and makes this policy more likely to pass a C-Faculty vote.

--

- _Russ seems anxious to get this policy finished_ after 2 years in progress. _He is also up for a job review_ in 2022.

--

- _The Contract Faculty Union effort is picking up steam again_ now that classes are in-person. A majority of C-Faculty in the university support the union. Several of the substantive recommendations from our draft policy are based on policies the union has successfully negotiated on behalf of adjunct faculty and grad student employees.

---

template: considerations

## Additional information (continued again)

- _It's possible that the C-FSC will again advise the Provost to reject this policy_, since it fails to address most of their concerns. But there's no guarantee.

--

- _It has always been our expectation that we would have to be willing to vote "no"_ in order to get any substantive concessions from leadership

--

- _It is safe to assume the vast majority of T-Faculty will vote "yes" again_... they probably won't even read it, since it doesn't concern them.

--

- _The C-FSC has explicitly advised us that we should not be afraid to carry on without a policy in place_. Leadership needs this more than we do.

--

- _Your vote counts and will be secret_ (at least this one time)!
