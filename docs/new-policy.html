# Background

## NYU trends

Increasing representation of contract faculty at the university.

- [NYU Adjuncts unionized](https://www.actuaw.org/) ~15 years ago and have seen [some real benefits](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NYU-Adjuncts-Local-7902-Before-and-After.pdf). Adjunct job security is in some ways better than that of Courant C-Faculty.

- A few years ago, the NYU Senate added representation of C-Faculty with the [Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/university-senate/membership/councils/ft-continuing-contract-faculty-senators-council.html) (C-FSC).

- NYU [graduate students unionized](https://makingabetternyu.org/) and entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the university in 2014, with real benefits. They [went on strike](https://progressive.org/latest/nyu-grad-student-union-strike-won-levin-210602/) in April 2021 and won more improvements.

- The effort to NYU [C-Faculty union](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/) effort again has support from `> 50%` of full-time contract faculty after a setback due to the pandemic.

_The trend is for contract faculty to demand recognition of the value of their work_, rather than wait for it to be acknowledged.

## Courant trends (1 of 3)

University bylaws _require all schools to have published policies_ in place for Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty (_C-Faculty_).

- Courant is one of the few schools without such a policy.

- In 2015, a C-Faculty policy was silently put into place _without any involvement of C-Faculty_. It was slightly modified in early 2019 and then mysteriously removed by mid-2019.

- In mid-2019, Director of Courant (Russ Caflisch), with the Steering Committee (Michael Overton, Bruce Kleiner, and Denis Zorin), drafted a new policy, again _with no involvement of C-Faculty_.

- A full faculty vote on the policy was held, and _the vote passed with less than half of C-Faculty voting_ (13 "yes"; 6 "no" out of 36 C-Faculty).

But it was not approved by the Provost...

## Courant trends (2 of 3)

_The C-FSC wrote a letter to the Provost noting many concerns with the policy_. The T-FSC wrote a letter in support of their concerns.

- In late 2020, _a committee was formed to revise the policy_ with 2 appointed T-Faculty, 2 appointed C-Faculty and 2 elected C-Faculty.

- In early 2021, _the committe drafted a proposed policy_, after extensive research and consultation with others around the university.

- The _proposed policy addressed all concerns_ raised by the C-FSC and included the best of what the committee had found elsewhere at NYU.

- Courant _leadership dismissed the committee's draft_ and began work on their own version again, in some consultation with the committee.

- In August 2021, the Director put the new policy up for vote. _C-Faculty overwhelming voted against it_ (1 "yes"; 32 "no").

---

## Courant trends (3 of 3)

Throughout 2021, the Director regularly consulted the committee on drafts of the policy, with _no meaningful concessions to requests for improvements_.

- In April 2022, in a series of meetings with the committee, _the Director agreed to compromise on many of the committee's concerns_.

- In May 2022, The Director and the committee agreed to put a _new proposal up for a new vote, with an accompanying memo_ from the Director specifying some additional details.

# C-Faculty Desires

--

## Basics of a fair policy (1 of 2)

In its work, the committee aimed for a set of terms that are hallmarks of a fair policy:

- **Equal voting rights** to T-Faculty, except on issues related to Tenure.

- Ability to **vote by secret ballot on all policies that affect C-Faculty**.

- **Inclusion in Courant governance**.

- **Majority C-Faculty on Reappointment & Promotions Committees**.

- **Professional development funds** with justification when withheld.

- **Ability to apply for promotion** at the time of any reappointment or any year after the second reappointment.

- **Longer appointment terms** at the higher end of NYU norms.

---

template: goals

## Basics of a fair policy (2 of 2)

- **Good-faith consideration for reappointment** to one's own job.

- **Equal or greater pay** when reappointed to one's own job.

- **Equal or greater length of terms** when reappointed to one's own job.

- **Clear expectations for what is considered during reappointment and promotion review**.

---

template: goals

## Reach

The committee argued for one desire that went beyond the simple basics:

- **Some promise of relief from high teaching loads**, such as paid leave or a one- or two-class reduction after 8 years of continuous service.

# Policy Up For Vote

--

## Basics of any fair policy (1 of 2)

After 1.5 years with no progress towards meeting any C-Faculty desires, the policy now up for vote, in combination with the Director's memo, addresses some:

- ✅ **Equal voting rights** to T-Faculty, except on issues related to Tenure.

- ✅ Ability to **vote by secret ballot on all policies that affect C-Faculty**.

- ✅ **Inclusion in Courant governance** and eligibility for leadership roles.

- ✅ **Majority C-Faculty on Reappointment & Promotions Committee**.

- ✅ **Professional development funds** with justification when withheld.

- ✅ **Ability to apply for promotion** at the time of any reappointment or any year after the second reappointment.

- ✅ **Longer appointment terms** at the higher end of NYU norms.

# Considerations

## Policy versus memo

The policy is intended to be updated once every 5 years at most with a faculty vote, whereas _the memo can be updated unilaterally by the Director at any time_.

- Some of the progress made is based primarily on language in the memo:

  - ⚠️ **Equal voting rights** to T-Faculty, except on issues of Tenure.
  - ⚠️ **Inclusion in Courant governance** and eligibility for leadership.
  - ⚠️ The amount of **professional development funds** available.
  - ⚠️ **Good-faith consideration for reappointment** to one's own job.
  - ⚠️ **Equal or greater pay** when reappointed to one's own job.
  - ⚠️ **Equal or greater length of terms** when reappointed to one's job.
  - ⚠️ **Possibility of promotion to full Clinical Faculty** without work that is external to Courant and NYU.

The memo grants C-Faculty the above if the policy passes the upcoming vote. But is unclear how "permanent" they would be.

## Governance policy

A policy specific to governance at Courant is going to be developed separately.

- **Language about governance in the memo may be placeholder** until such a policy is developed.

---

template: considerations

## No relief from high teaching loads

The justification for why **C-Faculty cannot be given any relief in their teaching burden** once every 8 years is that Courant cannot afford it.

- The committee has received confirmation that _Courant is paid by the university to some degree in proportion to the number of students taught_. Specific details of this arrangement have not been shared.

- Whether the income from the high course enrollments is enough to cover a one-course reduction once every 8 years is left for C-Faculty to guess.

- Several C-Faculty have received _a pair of cufflinks after 10 years of service_.
