## Our work

We have...

--

- Researched _national trends_.

--

- Reviewed all of _C-FSC's written feedback_ to Russ's original policy.

--

- Researched _all NYU policies_ applicable to contract faculty.

--

- _Interviewed C-Faculty_ we could get hold of for their views.

--

- _Conferred with other NYU contract faculty organizations_, including the C-FSC and the Contract Faculty Union organizers.

--

- Reviewed equivalent _policies at other NYU schools_.

--

- Drafted a new policy _from scratch_.

--

_We believe our draft policy is best-in-class and sets an example for others._

# Context

template: context

## Nationwide trends

Workforce shifts in higher-education.

--

- Tenure lines have been decreasing nation-wide over several decades across all institution types.

--

- ~75% of instructional positions nationwide are now held by contract faculty, and increasing.

--

- Part-time positions of one year or less make up the largest share of non-tenure track positions.

--

- Tenure has been seen as critical to the continuation of academic freedom at universities... till now.

--

_See the American Association of University Professors' [report on the shifting workforce](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/Shifting-Academic-Workforce-November-2016.pdf) for more_

## NYU trends

Increasing representation of contract faculty at the university.

--

- [NYU Adjuncts unionized](https://www.actuaw.org/) ~15 years ago and have seen [some real benefits](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NYU-Adjuncts-Local-7902-Before-and-After.pdf).

--

- A few years ago, the NYU Senate, which governs academics, was modified to include representation of contract faculty with the [Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/university-senate/membership/councils/ft-continuing-contract-faculty-senators-council.html) (C-FSC). They have been working to standardize and improve working conditions.

--

- [NYU graduate students unionized](https://makingabetternyu.org/) and entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the university in 2014, with real benefits.

--

- The [effort to unionize NYU Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/) now has support from > 50% of full-time contract faculty.

--

_The trend is for C-Faculty to demand recognition of the value of their work._

## Courant happenings

The regressive state of contract faculty at Courant.

--

1. The university bylaws _require all schools to have policies_ in place for Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty (_C-Faculty_) regarding appointments, promotions, grievances, and so on.
   _Courant has none._

--

1. Russ Caflish, Director of Courant, drafted a policy for C-Faculty
   with _no involvement from C-Faculty_.

--

1. Feedback was solicited on the draft just before the vote.
   _None of the feedback was incorporated into the final policy_.

--

1. A full faculty vote on the policy was held, including C-Faculty and Tenure/Tenure Track Faculty.

- _It was not a secret ballot_.
- _The vote was not organized and managed by C-Faculty_.
- _T-Faculty were voting on a policy affecting only C-Faculty._
- _The vast majority voted to pass the policy_.

---

template: context

## Courant happenings (continued)

The policy was sent to the Provost for approval.

--

- _Luckily, the C-FSC intervened_.
  They called foul, informing the Provost of the many flaws in the process and in the policy itself.

--

Russ thus formed this committee to revise the policy...

--

- _We threw it out._

# Minimally important

--

## Things every policy would have

Much of our draft policy is focused on things that any policy would have.

--

- Clarity on _job titles_, _job expectations_, and _terms_ of appointment.

--

- Clarity on the _reappointment_ process.

--

- Clarity on the _promotions_ process.

--

- Clarity on the _grievances_ process

--

- ## Restatement of existing NYU policies:
  ## _right to switch to Tenure-Track positions_,
  ## _right to hold meetings_,
  ## _right to be principal investigator on research_,
  ## _eligibility for university housing_ (no matter how unlikely),
  ## _right to course buyouts_,
  ## _right to outside employment 1 day per week_,
  _right to paid and unpaid leave_ for a variety of reasons.

--

_These are basics of any policy and nothing especially unique about ours._

---

# Nice to haves

--

## A step up from the bottom

On top of the bare minimum, a few reasonable rights.

--

- Good-faith attempts at _course load equity_ among C-Faculty.

--

- The possibility of _course load reductions_ for a variety of mundane reasons including curriculum development and course mode conversions.

--

- Guaranteed _contract clock stoppage_ for major life events and global pandemics, equivalent to the tenure clock stoppage policy.

--

- _Ample time to negotiate or appeal_ reappointment & promotion decisions.

--

- The _right to academic freedom_, like Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty have.

--

- ## _Self-governance_: C-Faculty should be the majority on their reappointment, promotion, and grievance committees.
  ## Only C-Faculty should vote on a C-Faculty policy.
  C-Faculty should be involved in hiring C-Faculty.

--

_These are little things that show a bit of respect for us._

---

# Worth fighting for

--

## The big stuff

Now we come to policies of material value.

--

- ## _Equal rights_: C-Faculty should have the same basic rights as Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty, except on issues related to tenure.
  ## This includes equal voting rights and the right to serve in all leadership positions,
  including Director of [Under]graduate Studies, Chair, etc.

--

- ## A promise of _professional development funds_,
  ## including 2-year rollover of unused funds.
  The requirement of a financial justification if these funds are ever withheld.

--

- ## _Guarantee of reappointment_, barring any structural/curricular changes or job performance issues.
  ## _Longer appointments_ that match other schools.
  One year of _termination pay_ if not reappointed for any other reason.

--

- _Sabbatical_ - eligibility after 6 years of service, just like Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty.

--

_If we want these things, we must be ready to vote for them._

## Expectations

Russ will be modifying our draft policy. We should expect that Courant will put up for vote a version of the policy that has:

--

- most or all of the [minimally-important things](#small-stuff).

--

- some of the [nice to haves](#medium-stuff).

--

- ## none of the [things worth fighting for](#big-stuff).
  It's unrealistic to expect these to be handed to us.

--

_But we have leverage._

---

template: voting

## Leverage

Several factors make this a great time to negotiate our standing.

--

- ## _Russ is on the defensive_ after the botched initial policy attempt.
  He is also relatively new here.

--

- Courant is _under pressure to wrap this business up_.

--

- With the huge surge in enrollments, _contract faculty are cash cows_, bringing in far more than we cost.

--

- The funds Courant receives for our over-enrollments are clearly being _used to make up for losses elsewhere_.

--

- What we're asking for _costs Courant almost nothing_.

--

- A large vote _no_ by C-Faculty on a policy would be a big embarrassment.

--

## _There will probably never be a better time to negotiate._
