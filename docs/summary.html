## Our work
We have...

--

- Researched *national trends*

--

- Researched *all NYU policies* applicable to contract faculty

--

- *Interviewed C-Faculty* we could get hold of for their views.

--

- *Conferred with NYU contract faculty organizations*, including the C-FSC and the contract faculty union effort.

--

- Reviewed equivalent *policies at other NYU schools*.

--

- Drafted a new policy *from scratch*.

--

*We believe our draft policy is best-in-class and sets an example for others.*

# Context

template: context

## Nationwide trends
Workforce shifts in higher-education.

--

- Tenure lines have been decreasing nation-wide over several decades across all institution types.

--

- ~75% of instructional positions nationwide are now held by contract faculty, and increasing.

--


- Part-time positions of one year or less make up the largest share of non-tenure track positions.

--


- Tenure has been seen as critical to the continuation of academic freedom at universities... till now.

--


*See the American Association of University Professors' [report on the shifting workforce](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/Shifting-Academic-Workforce-November-2016.pdf) for more*

## NYU Trends
Increasing representation of contract faculty at the university.

--

- [NYU Adjuncts unionized](https://www.actuaw.org/) ~15 years ago and have seen [some real benefits](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NYU-Adjuncts-Local-7902-Before-and-After.pdf).

--


- A few years ago, the NYU Senate, which governs academics, was modified to include representation of contract faculty with the [Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/university-senate/membership/councils/ft-continuing-contract-faculty-senators-council.html) (C-FSC).  They have been working to standardize and improve working conditions.

--


- [NYU graduate students unionized](https://makingabetternyu.org/) and entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the university in 2014, with real benefits.

--


- The [effort to unionize NYU Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty](https://nyucontractfacultyunion.org/) now has support from > 50% of full-time contract faculty.

--

*The trend is for C-Faculty to demand recognition of the value of their work.*

## The regressive state of contract faculty at Courant.

--

1. The university bylaws *require all schools to have policies* in place for Full-Time Continung Contract Faculty (*C-Faculty*) regarding appointments, promotions, grievances, and so on.  
--
*Courant has none.*

--

1. Russ Caflish, Director of Courant, drafted a policy for C-Faculty 
--
with *no involvement from C-Faculty*.

--

1. Feedback was solicited on the draft just before the vote.  
--
*None of the feedback was incorporated into the final policy*.

--

1. A full faculty vote on the policy was held, including C-Faculty and Tenure/Tenure Track Faculty.  
--
*It was not a secret ballot*.  
--
*The vote was not organized and managed by C-Faculty*.  
--
*T-Faculty were voting on a policy affecting only C-Faculty.*  
--
*The vast majority voted to pass the policy*.
--

1. The policy was sent to the Provost for approval.  
--
*Luckily, the C-FSC intervened*.  
--
They called foul, informing the Provost of the many flaws in the process and in the policy itself.

--

1. Russ thus formed this committee to revise the policy... 
--
*We threw it out.*

# Minimally important

--

## Things every policy would have
Much of our draft policy is focused on things that any policy would have.

--

- Clarity on *job titles*, *job expectations*, and *terms* of appointment.

--

- Clarity on the *reappointment* process.

--

- Clarity on the *promotions* process.

--

- Clarity on the *grievances* process

--

- Restatement of existing NYU policies: 
--
*right to switch to Tenure-Track positions*, 
--
*right to hold meetings*, 
--
*right to be principal investigator on research*, 
--
*eligibility for university housing* (no matter how unlikely), 
--
*right to course buyouts*, 
--
*right to outside employment 1 day per week*, 
--
*right to paid and unpaid leave* for a variety of reasons.

--

*These are basics of any policy and nothing especially unique about ours.*

# Nice to haves

--

## A step up from the bottom
On top of the bare minimum, a few reasonable rights.

--

- Good-faith attempts at *course load equity* among C-Faculty.

--

- The possibility of *course load reductions* for a variety of mundane reasons including curriculum development and course mode conversions.

--

- Guaranteed *contract clock stoppage* for major life events and global pandemics, equivalent to the tenure clock stoppage policy.

--

- *Ample time to negotiate or appeal* reappointment & promotion decisions.

--

- The *right to academic freedom*, like Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty have.

--

- *Self-governance*: C-Faculty should be the majority on their reappointment, promotion, and grievance committees.  
--
Only C-Faculty should vote on a C-Faculty policy.  
--
C-Faculty should be involved in hiring C-Faculty.

--

*These are little things that show a bit of respect for us.*

# Worth fighting for

--

## The big stuff
Now we come to policies of material value.

--

- *Equal rights*: C-Faculty should have the same basic rights as Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty, except on issues related to tenure.  
--
This includes equal voting rights and the right to serve in all leadership positions, 
--
including Director of [Under]graduate Studies, Chair, etc.

--

- A promise of *professsional development funds*, including 2-year rollover of unused funds.  
--
The requirement of a financial justification if these funds are ever withheld.

--

- *Guarantee of reappointment*, barring any structural/curricular changes or job performance issues.  
--
1 year of termination pay if not reappointed for any other reason.

--

- *Sabbatical* - eligibility after 6 years of service, just like Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty.

--

*If we want these things, we must be ready to vote for them.*

# Voting

## Expectations
Russ will be modifying our draft policy.  We should expect that Courant will put up for vote a version of the policy that has:

--

- most or all of the [minimally-important things](#small-stuff).

--

- some of the [nice to haves](#medium-stuff).

--

- none of the [things worth fighting for](#big-stuff).  
--
It's unrealistic to expect these to be handed to us.

--

*But we have leverage.*

---

template: voting

## Leverage
Several factors make this a great time to negotiate our standing.

--

- *Russ is on the defensive* after the botched initial policy attempt.  
--
He is also relatively new here.

--

- Courant is *under pressure to wrap this business up*.

--

- With the huge surge in enrollments, *contract faculty are cash cows*, bringing in far more than we cost.

--

- The funds Courant receives for our over-enrollments are clearly being *used to make up for losses elsewhere*.

--

- What we're asking for *costs Courant almost nothing*.

--

- A large vote *no* by C-Faculty on a policy would be a big embarrassment.

--

*There will probably never be a better time to negotiate.*
